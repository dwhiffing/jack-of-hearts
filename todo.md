hearts should repel each other so you can't place them all in one spot

show core effects while holding core
hitting an enemy should reset its current attack?
exploding enemies should launch players if they are holding a core (if player is holding core, core takes damage)

shaman: moves within range of player, charges up, then applies debuff to player via ray cast. could reduce damage, reduce speed etc
skeleton: throws bones at hearts to deal chip damage
lizard: targets player and slashes for long hit stun. blocks attacks except for right after slash. have to dodge then strike

if cores are near eachother, they both take damage (show circle if two cores are too close)

- waves should spawn from a specific side, and be indicated in advance so the player can move their cores away from it?
  chain lightning attack upgrade + other ideas from hades
  upgrades that change attack type. ie combo, single fast attack, single slow attack with larger radius

idea 1: Desk Dispatch - Keep files organized on a desk, get regular requests for information found in the files. The more files you have, the harder it is to find the information
idea 2: roguelite topdown action - keep the core alive, every round get to pick one upgrade and one downgrade and combine them into a secondary core. lose both if the secondary core is destroyed. lose game if primary core is destroyed
